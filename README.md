# Data Science Minor Personal Portfolio
This Github repository serves as personal portfolio for my data science minor. The minor is taught at 
the Hague University of Applied Sciences and requires a personal portfolio that includes the contributions
to the project as well as individual efforts. 

# Readers guide 
This page includes an introduction to the subjects that are mentioned in this repository. 
It is composed of three components. The courses, the data science components and the project specific items. 


## Courses
The courses that I have done for this minor have 2 sources, one being Datacamp and the other being Coursera. 
These courses have both taught me a lot about data 
science, and therefore helped me with the progress I have 
made in the field and the project.

### Datacamp
Starting with Datacamp. The approach to these courses was very practical. 
They usually taught a very specific part of data science and how you could implement this in code. 
Already having some experience in Python, some of their courses were a nice refresher 
while others taught me a lot.

In the Datacamp document I explain per course what every one of 
them has served me and how it helped me with the project.

### Coursera 
Coursera's approach to learning data science was far more theoretical, this was a perfect combination with 
Datacamp. Learning when to use instead of how to use, provided a lot of insight and sped up the 
learning process. The specific course is Machine Learning by Andrew NG, the founder of Coursera.

## Data Science Components
The components mentioned below are subcategories of data science
of which the function will be explained by examples. These subcategories have either been a part of 
the project or have been experimented with individually. 

### Data collection 
Data Collection is the part of data science of retrieving data point. This could be connecting to an API, 
Manually collecting data or in the case of our project: retrieving data manually from the CBS framework.

Data collection is the first step in the process, you need to have data to perform any actions on it.

### Data Preparation
Data Preparation is the art of editing your data in such a way that you can create algorithms for them. 
This can be just removing empty cells to converting words to vectors.

### Data Visualisation
The visualization of data has a very important role in data science. 
It can, if used right, communicate information clearly. 
It can provide insight that would be complicated to retrieve from the data itself.

### Diagnostics of the Learning Process
In this chapter I will discuss the data science learning process. 
Reflecting on how and why specific choices were made by me and my project group.

### Evaluation
Evaluation of a Model/Visualization/Preparation will be discussed in this chapter. It will include most 
of the other chapters so if you have no basic knowledge on the topics, I advice you to check them first

### Predictive Models
This chapter I will discuss Predictive modelling, as used in the project, aswell as a few project-unrelated examples.

## Project
### Presentations
Every week the progress that the project group made, had to be presented to our peers and teachers. 
These presentations were done in turns, usually by 2 presenters. I presented about every other
presentation. The making of the presentation and processing of feedback after the presentations has 
been a joint performance.

### Scrum
In the first part of the project, we worked with SCRUM.
This later turned out to be not that practical for us as a group. Regardless, 
I will discuss a few SCRUM tasks I have worked on.
