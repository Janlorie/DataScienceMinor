# Diagnostics of the Learning process
During this minor I learned more on machine learning than I would have thought. Since the concept of AI and ML 
seemed very abstract I expected the course to include a lot of theory. The fact that a lot of it came down to 
practical implementations and experiments, causes me to be even more interested in the subject. 

Unfortunately I cannot point to any real evidence of progression of learning other than the results provided in the 
form of examples. I had next to no knowledge of most of these subjects and do now. 

## Datacamp
Datacamp has started this practical process. The approachable way of teaching, appeals to me. The assigned courses 
came to be very useful as well. This process did not run into any specific problems, learning related. The courses 
followed up well and expanded on each others knowledge.

## Coursera
Coursera provided a nice background to Datacamps practical work. The theory taught had an understanding of the 
concepts as result. As opposed to datacamp where it was not understanding how it worked but how  certain concepts 
can be implemented.

## Project Related 
The tasks and experiments in the project were a key component to a lot of the understanding. Because we had to 
find out most of the solutions to problems we had, we read a lot and tried a lot of different things.

## Other
Jeroens lessons specifically taught me different views on the same subjects as coursera. These different views 
provided a broader understanding of the taught concepts, this did help in the learning process. 

## Communication
The communication between project group peers was good. There were no limitations regarding communication. Everybody
felt and was approachable and willing to share and or help progress the project.

## Document Sharing
The document sharing we set up was through sharepoint, with Word online as platform to edit documents. This was not a 
good experience and limited us a number of times where files got corrupted, working on the same document together was 
not possible as well as the layout not displaying properly across our computers. I would not use this service again. 

## Conclusion
The different sources of information and different types of tasks formed a well thought out process. All pieces 
were placed right, in my experience.
