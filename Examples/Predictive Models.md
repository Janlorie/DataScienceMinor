# Predictive Modelling
Predictive modelling is the actual code that is the implementation of machine learning or AI. These are ways to 
find correlations between found parameters or features in your data set. 

### Cost functions
A big part in predictive modelling is the understanding of the cost function. There are several types of cost 
functions for types of scoring. The cost functions generally is a function that calculates the error for a 
specific model. It does so by getting the cumulative error on the training examples of a model. The function that 
fits the model iterates over the data to find the function(model) with the smallest output of the cost function.

## Regression
Regression is a concept where you try to regress data to a function. You try to fit the data to a line with the 
smallest error.

### Linear
Linear regression is the simpelest form of regression where you regress data to a linear line. The function for such 
a line has a format of y= ax + b.

##### Data
##### Visual

### Polynomial

### Regularization
Regularization is a factor in machine learning that penalizes extreme values. This parameter can be passed to 
create a more generalized model. 
#### Example
##### Before
##### After

## Classification
Classification broadly explained is the creating of a machine learning model that can put out a discrete value. An 
example of this is a binary classifier that either outputs 1 or zero.

### Example
#### Data
#### Visual

### Descision Boundary
Classification can also be done with specific types of regression, such as Logistic regression. These models put out 
a chance of one of the values which then is translated to one of the discrete values.
