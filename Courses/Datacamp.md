# Datacamp Courses
Datacamp takes a very practical approach to learning. Every course and chapter starts with a video explaining a 
concept, the assignments after that implement the explained topic with prepared data. This allowed me to 
experiment quite fast. The completed courses were mostly assigned however some of the assignments included just 
one or two chapters, I decided to complete all the partial courses.

Some of these courses contributed to the project. Others weren't relevant to the project but did 
expand our knowledge on Data science as a whole. Below is a screenshot of the completed courses.
