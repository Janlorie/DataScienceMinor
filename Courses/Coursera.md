#Coursera Machine Learning course
[link to the course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
The machine learning course on Coursera is taught by Andrew NG, the co-founder of the platform and a professor at
Stanford University. The course is taught with a more theoretical approach. The mathematics behind concepts are discussed and explained 
by examples. The course has taught me a lot and contributed to the project through understanding the functions we 
were using.

Since the subjects taught in this course overlap completely with the data science components, examples will be 
provided in those documents. The concepts taught in the course however will be listed underneath.

I have not completed all the 'weeks' in the course. The ones I did, are listed below.

####week 1
* linear regression
* Gradient descent

####week 2
* Multiple features 
* Polynomials 
* Gradient descent for multivariate
* Normal Equation


####week 3
* Classification
* Hypothesis representation
* Descision Boundary
* Cost function
* Advanced optimization
* Multiclass Classification
* Overfitting
* Regularized Linear Regression
* Regularized Logistic Regression

####week 6
* Evaluating a Learning Algorithm
* Model selection
* Bias vs Variance
* Diagnosis
* Regularization
* Learning curves
